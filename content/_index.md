# Welcome to my new website

I am interested in studying social, group and political behaviour. I apply techniques from mathematical modelling, machine learning and data science to these topics. Studies include:

* Impacts of online vaccine misinformation on vaccines uptake
* Measuring the performance of different categories of political TikTok posts
* Understanding how and why people post about UK immigration
* I was among the first to identify and online communities, often known as echo chambers, on Twitter
* And I've worked on social behaviour in many animals including Bees! Why do bee colonies collapse?

I am currently working freelance, I have previously held these positions

* Executive Director of the Indiana University Observatory on Social Media
* Senior Research Fellow at Royal Holloway University of London
* Research Fellow at University of Leeds
